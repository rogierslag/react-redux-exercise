# Practise for React/Redux (Magnet.me)

For people wishing to practise with adding functionality for React/Redux.
Originally developed for the mob-programming exercise but unsed.

As an example, add the following data:

1. Connect the React app to the server using websockets
1. It pushes data to the client at irregular intervals
1. Get this data to the middleware, and ensure it is properly pushed into the store.

Run the server using `node index.js` (use node 6+).
You can connect locally to `ws://localhost:9000`
